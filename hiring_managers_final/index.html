          When I received your email containing my 40th rejection letter of the
          month, I swore there was something wrong with me. But after some
          self-reflection (and the passing of my anxiety attack when someone
          asked me where I’d be this summer), I realized I had been gaslit.

          Your scathing “we’ve decided to go in another direction” left me with
          no motivation, no happiness, just a seething anger for all the
          Northwestern nepo babies who keep posting on LinkedIn. I have no other
          choice than to regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your
          letter of rejection. I understand the position I applied for was
          extremely competitive, receiving a record number of applicants, but I
          have no other options. I have received a record number of rejections,
          and I NEED a job this summer.

          This was a difficult decision for me to make, and it shouldn’t be
          taken lightly. Considering the only club I’m a part of doesn’t have
          any Greek letters attached to it, I understand there may have been
          more qualified people.

          Upon reflection, I definitely could’ve worked harder. I wish I had
          started networking with Blackstone analysts when I was 12 so I
          wouldn’t have to deal with being ghosted by hiring departments full of
          corporate 20-somethings who make six figures out of college. Clearly,
          it’s too late for that.

          I will be at your doorstep in my business-casual best promptly at 9
          a.m. on June 10. Unfortunately, I will have to take a sabbatical on
          August 10 because I’m vacationing in Cabo. And before I begin next
          month, you should know that I do have a few limitations. For one, I’m
          exclusively willing to work in the city I grew up in because I am

          only comfortable in my mother’s home. I also need at least $25 an hour
          because this life (aka vacationing in Cabo) doesn’t pay for itself —
          and neither do my parents. I’m also hoping for three weeks off and the
          option to work from home, because the thought of a 40-hour work week
          may actually bring me to an “off the grid” lifestyle in a log cabin in
          the woods. Lastly, I need a guaranteed internship for next summer and
          a job offer after graduation because God knows I won’t be applying for
          any more jobs.

          Again, I sincerely appreciate the time and effort you devoted to
          rejecting me. Please know this is not a reflection of the quality of
          your workplace, nor should you be discouraged by the news of my
          arrival. I look forward to hearing from you. And seeing you. June 10.
