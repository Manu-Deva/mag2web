        A white dress with ruffles accented with blue lace and ribbons. At first
        glance, it is a beautiful, feminine dress from the early 20th century.
        Upon further inspection, one can see the blue lace detailing at the top
        forming a Star of David around the neck. The neckline rises high up
        toward the chin, circling tightly around the throat. <img
          src="images/RIFKELE_DRESS.png"
          style="float: right; max-width: 40%; max-height: auto"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Rifkele is the character who wears this dress in Indecent, the Virginia
        Wadsworth Wirtz Center of Performing Arts’s spring production. Her
        religiously conservative parents exalt strict control over her, and the
        lace Star of David around her neck mimics the constrictive environment
        she lives in. The dress appears to be choking her, representative of how
        the forces of her family and religion restrict her freedom of who she
        wants to love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Costume designers are an integral part of the theater production team,
        and their work requires not only artistic skill but also creative vision
        and analytical thinking. The in-depth analysis of how Rifkele’s costume
        conveys Indecent’s themes is just a fraction of the work Master of Fine
        Arts (MFA) graduate student Lia Wallfish, the costume designer for
        Wirtz’s Indecent, puts in when designing costumes for theater
        productions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wirtz puts on multiple shows every year, and the costume designers play
        a critical part in the final performances. The costume shop located
        inside Wirtz is a safe haven for the designers. Bobbins of thread
        stacked on a rack, various hats strewn across a table, mannequins
        scattered across the room; the seemingly hectic space is where
        creativity thrives.
      </p>

      <p class="article-headings" style="color: #ffcd03">
        <em>The designers</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Wallfish has always had a love for design. She went to an arts high
        school where she could pursue her passion for fashion. It wasn’t until
        her internship at the Metropolitan Opera, her first experience working
        with costumes on a large scale, that her interest shifted to costume
        design.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That was really my first time I realized how costume design relates to
        the storytelling and how it can affect the whole production,” Wallfish
        says. She decided to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in theater with a
        concentration in costume design at the University of California, Los
        Angeles. 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        MFA graduate student Alaina Moore had a similar journey into costume
        design. She was a general art and design student at Columbia College
        Chicago and focused on fashion for a while. She eventually found her way
        into a theater environment and quickly fell in love with costume
        design. 
      </p>
      <p>
        “I love being kind of limited in a way by a specific story,” Moore says.
        “It kind of reigns in what can be a chaotic curiosity that I have about
        the world.” Other costume designers at Wirtz were drawn to the field as
        an extracurricular but pursued other academic interests during their 
        undergraduate years. MFA graduate student Ben Kress majored in
        psychology at Kenyon College. During his junior year, he took a costume
        design class for fun. He fell in love with it and began working on
        student productions, using work-study hours to spend time in the costume
        shop.

        “It felt in line with why I was interested in psychology, too, because
        it’s really just exploring why we are who we are and who we can be but
        through art,” Kress says. Eventually, this extracurricular passion
        became a post-graduation internship at a theater in Baltimore, Maryland,
        which turned into a professional career for over six years.

      <p class="article-headings" style="color: #ffcd03">
        <em>Storytelling through <br />costumes</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Storytelling is an essential component of every show and is also
        integral to the costume designer’s creative process. Costume designers
        help bring characters to life and directors’ visions to fruition. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Wallfish briefly worked in the costume departments of television series
        like American Horror Story and American Crime Story, but she says the
        creative freedom and storytelling of theater create a more enticing
        expression of artistry. Moore agrees the storytelling and collaborative
        aspect drew her away from fashion and into costume design.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s such an ecosystem, a sort of system of storytelling, and I really
        love that about it,” Moore says. “I love that the collaborative aspect
        of theater gets me out of my own head and my own creative imagination
        and makes it this whole community coming together to tell a story.” 
      </p>

      <p>
        Kress values storytelling and its effects on the characters he’s working
        on. He recognizes that clothes are often the first thing a person sees
        about a character, and audiences can form many impressions about a
        character at first glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve been thinking about my art as a kind of a conversation in that
        way,” Kress says. “When this character shows up on stage, you’re
        thinking about, ‘What is the first thing you want the audience to
        hear?’”
      </p>

      <p>
        During Fall Quarter, Kress was the costume designer for the Wirtz
        production Me…Jane, a show about Jane Goodall, the famous anthropologist
        who worked closely with chimpanzees. He connected with the production
        because he could follow her real-life journey of connecting with nature
        and becoming an environmental activist. Kress explored themes of
        sustainability to guide his designs for the show; most of the clothes
        were thrifted, and a prop chicken was made entirely out of discarded
        denim. 
      </p>

      <p class="article-headings" style="color: #ffcd03">
        <em>The creative process</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Wallfish has an elaborate creative process for designing the final
        costume. After receiving the show’s script, she reads through it once
        without making any notes. Next, she re-reads the script and takes notes
        about the time period, location and descriptors of the characters. She
        then does visual research for costume design and world-building. After
        meeting with the director and discussing a shared vision for the
        production, she begins creating quick gesture drawings which will later
        become the final renderings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moore has a similar process involving an analysis of the script,
        in-depth historical research and designing the final image. She prefers
        to use a collage technique to create the final renderings of costumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moore implements the historical research into the design but also likes
        to break away from historical conventions, updating costumes based on a
        liberal interpretation of the text. Evidence of Moore’s intermingling of
        historical fact and creative exploration can be seen in the bridal gown
        worn in Blood Wedding, the Wirtz show she was the costume designer for
        during Winter Quarter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wedding dress is a black Victorian lace gown, as described in the
        original play. The bridal gown is black, as is the traditional style of
        wedding gowns from Andalusia, Spain, the region where the story takes
        place. Moore maintained the Victorian style in the angular neckline but
        modernized the rest of the dress. She formed lines in the skirt of the
        dress to mimic the Art Deco style of the 1930s, which is when the play
        was written.

          The blue lace detailing at the top is meant to form a Star of David.
        </cite>
      </p>

      <p>
        Staging for shows can also create unique challenges for costume
        designers. In Indecent, all performers remain on stage and visible to
        the audience the entire time. Each actor plays multiple roles throughout
        the play and has numerous costume changes that have to occur while on
        stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’re actually using a lot of magnets for this show because it’s much
        faster than velcro or snaps,” Wallfish says. “It’s much easier for the
        actress to get it right.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Before coming to Northwestern, Kress had the opportunity to design
        costumes for community organizations that put on shows for prisoners.
        The prison environment posed a creative challenge; security limited many
        common items from being brought into the prison, such as sneakers.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s few things you can bring in there, so the whole world has to be
        basically on their bodies,” Kress says. “You have to do all the
        world-building kind of involved in the clothes, and we still got to be
        super creative.”
      </p>
      <p>
        This process of adapting to different environments, audiences,
        director’s suggestions and more poses a creative challenge that requires
        designers to be open to constant change and not become too attached to
        their first rendering.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Costume design is an expression of art, and I love myself as an
        artist,” Kress says. “Maybe one day, I’ll want to express that in a
        different way, and that’s an openness to change that I hope to continue
        to foster here.”
